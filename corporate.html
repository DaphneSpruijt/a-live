          <!-- End Production, start Marketing -->

          <h2 id="marketing" class="mt-5">Marketing</h2>
          <h4 id="marketing-1" class="mt-2">Context of campaign and promotional activities</h4>
          <p>For our campaign, we focused on promoting our hard rock cover band concerts mainly on Instagram. We advertised on Instagram because that is where most of our target audience, and therefor also our persona, is; young people from 16 to 35 years old who are interested in music, memes, and short videos.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>The goal of the campaign was to introduce our brand and generate hype for our concerts in the Netherlands. Our brand is all about bringing back hard rock classics with amazing cover bands, now that a lot of the original artists do not tour anymore or are extremely expensive. We want to keep hard rock alive by electrifying it with renewed energy and make sure that future generations can experience this energy of live hard rock music.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>In order to stand out, we made funny and relatable Instagram Reels. They were centered around real frustrations people have with concert culture like outrageous ticket prices, age limits, or not being able to watch their favorite hard rock bands live anymore. We used humor to communicate that our events are different: we are welcoming, there are no age limits, and the vibe is just fun and great music.&nbsp;</p>
            
         
          <h4 id="marketing-2" class="mt-4">Learning Points</h4>
          <p>CapCut was a convenient instrument to find meme templates and create original reels. Our Barbie reel from CapCut reached 93.4% of non-followers, 552 accounts, and had 725 views. This was our best result overall, and this taught us that meme reels can be an efficient tool to achieve our reach goal. The instruments we used to create content were CapCut, Canva for the posts and TikTok to search for sounds and create reels. The issue we faced as a business account is that we were not allowed to use music from the famous rock bands. This limitation did not allow us to create more engaging posts with the actual AC/DC songs. Instead, we used free to use rock music from artists with the Instagram license. Even though we did not have any product content to promote, we found a way to still promote the event by using posters and reels.&nbsp;</p>
          <ol>
          <p><strong>What worked well</strong>&nbsp;</p>
                <li>The reels worked well to reach the audience. We almost achieved our reach goal through reels alone. We have achieved our affect objectives for the beginning of campaign. The reels made people laugh, which is a good way to get people engaged.</li>
                
          <p><li>We also saw a larger reach for the grandma poster, which worked better than expected. It also received more interest from followers. We can utilize the idea behind the concept to create a full-scale campaign, filming reels with an actual grandma and making her almost an ambassador for the brand.</li> </p>
            
          <p><li>The PopTart reel with a Tik-Tok sound had an average watch time of 8 seconds, which is a good result. We have reached our response objective to get a reel with a view rate past first three seconds more than 50% with two reels, the Barbie and the PopTart.</li> </p>
          </ol>
        
        <ol>
          <p><strong>&nbsp;What did not work well</strong>&nbsp;</p>
          <p><li>The reel that was posted at 8 in the morning did not do well. This was a learning point and for the rest of the campaign we only posted after 18:00.</li>
          </p>
          <p><li>It takes time to find the right footing with the type of humour and finding CapCut template that works for reels.</li></p>
  </ol>  
            
            <ol>
          <p><strong>&nbsp;What would we do differently?</strong></p>
          <p><li>Post all the reels only after 18:00, since it affects the account reach. Posting too early in the morning sunk one of our reels.</li>
          </p>
          <p><li>If we had the resources, we would have created more original content with the cover bands themselves. In the interviews, our target group has expressed interest in content with the cover bands. Before going to the concert, they would check the Instagram to see how the bands play and how the event feels. If we had a real cover band, we would have created more content introducing the band and the music they play.</li></p>
          <p><li>Create a full-scale marketing campaign “Rock Grandma”. The idea came too late in the campaign to utilize it to the full scale. &nbsp;</li>
          </p>
          </ol>

  <p>Our first 6 posts are showing our four values; Come As You Are, Shoot To Thrill, Long Live Rock, and Back In Black. These values are all based on hard rock songs. These posts are created in Canva and includes our original logo. We created an original poster for each of our values to introduce our brand, using the colour scheme and logo. We wanted our posters to look like retro rock album covers, so they are made in a collage style.

            <p>Our last grid includes a 3 posts grid with 3 concepts about our brand: Everyone is welcome, Tips for a concert, and a comparison with a real hard rock concert. </p>
              
           <ul> <p><strong>Why You Should Invite Your Grandparents post 1/3</strong>&nbsp;Results</p> 
            <p>We decided to go a funny poster about grandparents because it highlights the no age restriction for the event and correlates with our effect objective. This post gave us an idea for the theoretical next marketing campaign “Rock Grandma”, which can be used to promote the event. This concept is unique, funny and light-hearted and can appeal to our audience. For this post we have the following statistics:&nbsp;5 likes 146 views, 43.8% non-followers Accounts reached 101 Accounts engaged 6 Profile visits 4. </p>
              
             <p><strong>Tips For Your First Rockconcert post 2/3</strong>&nbsp;Results</p> 
            <p>For the second poster, we wanted to try a new approach. It is still a poster that is part of a 3-post grid for coherency and visual aesthetics. We have tips listed such as bringing your earplugs and powerbank, to drink enough water, and we included a line “bring your grandma” to continue the reference to the campaign. For this post we have the following statistics: 2 likes 40 views, 5.0% non-followers Accounts reached 29 Accounts engaged 2 Profile visits 3 . </p>
              
             <p><strong>Concert Comparison post 3/3</strong>&nbsp;Results</p> 
            <p>The next AC/DC concert in Europe is in Dusseldorf and its 165,50 euro per ticket. We were inspired by the WowFoods post comparing American pancakes to cottage cheese pancakes. We decided to compare the expensive concert to our event, highlighting our main selling points. Our event is affordable, close to home and anyone can come. For this post we have the following statistics: 2 likes 68 views, 4.4% non-followers Accounts reached 41 Accounts engaged 2 Profile visits 2. </p> </ul>
